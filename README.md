Simulation of transient thermal processes.\
This is simulation using finite element method where the differential equation describing the process of transient thermal has been implemented.\
There was using some of numerical methods like Gauss integration. Simulation parameters are entered from an external text file.

## Inspiration
Project was done as part of FEM classes.
